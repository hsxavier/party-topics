# Party topics

This is a [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) web app that identifies topics of interest of
political parties on the Brazilian 2022 elections by counting the keywords mentioned by
candidates for deputado federal on their public pages on facebook.

It uses the Facebook's [Graph API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/).

This project was carried out  by [Henrique Xavier](http://henriquexavier.net) (<https://github.com/hsxavier>).
